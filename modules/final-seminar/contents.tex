Now you should be able to design a method to answer a given research question.
Hence, in this assignment you should show that you can do exactly that.
You will be assigned a research question (or set of related research questions) 
for which you should propose a way to answer scientifically.

Combine different methods to answer.
Supply chain.
Secure micro-services.

Feedback to improve method for another question.

Background: formal verification etc., different approaches.

\section{Assessment}\label{Assessment}

The learning objectives that we want to assess are the following, after 
completion of the course we want the student to be able to
\begin{enumerate}[label={(LO\arabic*)},ref=LO\arabic*]
  \item \LOrelate;
  \item \LOevaluate;
  \item \LOapply;
  \item \LOplan; and
  \item \LOcomm.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Material you should produce}

You should
\begin{itemize}
  \item write a report, and
  \item make a presentation (10 minutes).
\end{itemize}
These should should contain:
\begin{itemize}
  \item your research questions,
  \item how you propose to answer the questions (methods used),
  \item why those methods answer the questions properly,
  \item alternative methods that you discarded (and why), and, finally,
  \item your original plan for the course work, adaptations made and what you 
    learned.
\end{itemize}
This assesses \cref{LOrelate,LOevaluate,LOapply,LOcomm,LOplan}.

\paragraph{Feedback you should provide}

You should also
\begin{itemize}
  \item review someone else's report.
\end{itemize}
This assesses \cref{LOrelate,LOevaluate} and provides a learning opportunity 
for \cref{LOcomm}.
This also contributed to \ref{LOplan} as one would learn from others' mistakes.

The presentation should also include
\begin{itemize}
  \item what you learned from the feedback of the reviewer, and
  \item what you learned from the work you reviewed.
\end{itemize}
This also assesses \cref{LOcomm}.
