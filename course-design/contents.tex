    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}

  \pause

  \begin{block}{The goal}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Give a holistic view of Science of Security.
      \item What are the methods we use and why?
      \item Where are the disputes, philosophical problems and why?
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{A master's programme}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \begin{block}{MSc Cybersecurity}
    \begin{description}
      \item[Programme co-ordinators] Sonja Buchegger and Mathias Ekstedt
      \item[Started] Autumn 2022
      \item[First round of theses] Spring 2024
    \end{description}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item My previous experience of master students is that their skills 
        leave some things to be desired.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

  \pause

  \begin{block}{Aim of Science of Security course}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Complement the general methods course.
      \item Better prepare students for thesis (and hopefully worklife \dots).
      \item They should be able to contribute to scientifically based 
        development in cybersecurity.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  After passing the course, the student should be able to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<+> relate the different parts of scientific method, how they relate 
      to one another, contribute and not contribute to scientificity in 
      security
    \item<+> assess, analyse, and discuss the quality in, and ethical aspects 
      of, knowledge generation related to digital systems and in particular the 
      security of these systems
    \item<+> apply scientific methodology to show how to answer issues in the 
      cybersecurity field
    \item<+> \dots
%    \item<+> plan and carry out assignments within given time frames and 
%      available resources
%    \item<+> write short, clear and arguing texts based on own analysis as well 
%      as given material.
  \end{itemize}
  in order to be able to contribute to scientifically based development.

\section{More concretely}

\subsection{The goal}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[\enquote{Provable security}]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item A uniformly random string of length \(n\) is the most secure 
        password.

      \item We can prove it will take millions of years to guess it.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{remark}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Attackers still get in, weird \dots
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{example}[Usability]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Turns out people can't handle uniformly random passwords.
      \item Particularly not with a unique such password for every service.
      \item They can't generate uniformly random passwords either.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{example}

  \pause

  \begin{remark}[Several aspects]
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We want students to handle complex problems.
      \item Should see there are several aspects.
      \item Aspects must be approached differently.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{remark}

\section{Conclusions and discussion}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{block}{From 2020}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item<+> Emphasis on practice, not only on philosophy of science, to be 
        able to evaluate how strong a claim is justified in one's own and 
        others' publications and to learn to apply scientific methods to 
        increase the confidence in new results.

      \item<+> How is the progression compared to the \enquote{normal} 
        methodology  course?
        \begin{itemize}
          \item What is the added value?
          \item Focus on specifics of security, assume participants have taken 
            \enquote{regular} research methods course.
        \end{itemize}

      \item<+> Target audience? Half-way-through students?

      \item<+> 20+ students said they wanted such a course.
